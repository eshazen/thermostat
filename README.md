# Thermostat ideas

Thinking a bit along the Nest(TM) line:

* Simple on-board UI with e-ink display and a knob
* Remote access via web browser to change the schedule, etc
* Powered by a USB charger
* Battery backup when AC power missing (low-power mode keeps schedule and on-board UI alive but no remote access)
* No cloud services, registration or black boxes with Chinese firmware

Hardware?

* ATMega family
* Separate WiFi module which can be completely powered down

The Multi-Tens project is fairly close:  http://ohm.bu.edu/trac/edf/wiki/MultiTEMS
